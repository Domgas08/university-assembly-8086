## 8086 Assembly – University Assignments

This repository contains a collection of 8086 Assembly programs written as part of university coursework. The assignments focus on low-level programming, instruction decoding, file processing, and interrupt handling.

The repository demonstrates:
- Assembly programming fundamentals
- Working with interrupts
- File input/output
- ASCII and character processing
- Instruction format decoding (ModR/M, immediate values)
- Understanding of low-level system behavior

### Contents

- **ascii-codes/**  
  Program that reads a string and prints ASCII codes of each character
  in decimal format.

- **char-frequency/**  
  Program that reads a text file and counts how many times each character
  appears, writing the results to an output file.

- **int1-step-mode/**  
  INT 1 (single-step) interrupt handler that recognizes and analyzes
  `ADD r/m, immediate` and `OR r/m, immediate` instructions, including operand decoding.

All programs were written in 8086 Assembly as part of academic assignments.
